        <h2>A Brief History of Elections</h2>
		<p>
          Elections have been a part of American history since September 13, 1778, when
		  the Confederation Congress passed an ordinace related to elections, which established dates for
		  choosing electors, electing presidents, and the begining of a new government under Our Constitution.
		  Shortly after the first election of the United States was held on Monday, December 15, 1788 where George
		  Washington was elected for his first of his two terms as president, and John Adams as vice president.
        </p>

		  As for Chicago, Our city has been holding their mayoral elections ever since Chicago was incorporated as
		  a city in 1837. The first mayor of Chicago was elected in 1837, his name was William B. Ogden. Ogden's term lasted
		  only a year, as from 1838 through 1875, mayoral term lengths were only 1 year long. Interestingly, mayoral elections
		  were held every year from 1838 through 1875, even though their dates were modified several times.
