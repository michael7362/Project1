        <h2>A Brief History of Elections</h2>
		<p>
          Elections have been a part of American history since September 13, 1778, when
		  the Confederation Congress passed an ordinace related to elections, which established dates for
		  choosing electors, electing presidents, and the begining of a new government under Our Constitution.
		  Shortly after the first election of the United States was held on Monday, December 15, 1788 where George
		  Washington was elected for his first of his two terms as president, and John Adams as vice president.
        </p>
		<p>
		  As for Chicago, Our city has been holding their mayoral elections ever since Chicago was incorporated as
		  a city in 1837. The first mayor of Chicago was elected in 1837, his name was William B. Ogden. Ogden's term lasted
		  only a year, as from 1838 through 1875, mayoral term lengths were only 1 year long. Interestingly, mayoral elections
		  were held every year from 1838 through 1875, even though their dates were modified several times throughout history.
		</p>
		<h2>Importance of Voting</h2>
		<p>
		  The most recent Municipal Runoff Election was held in 2019. Based on the statistics provided by chicagoelections.gov,
		  the 2019 Municipal Runoff Election had the worst turnout in elecetions in recent history. A turnout is definded
		  to be the participation rate of a given election based on the amount of registered, eligible, or of-age voters. The turnout for
		  the 2019 Municipal Runoffs Election was 33.08%, with 1,592,658 registered voters and with 526,886 ballot casts.
		  Just 1/3 of Chicago's eligible voters were participating in this election. The poor involvement of the other 2/3 of
		  the registered voters do not represent the city of Chicago very well by skipping out voting, and minimizing chances for a genuine change
		  in the city.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Your vote matters! Do not make the mistake of avoiding or forgetting to vote. Your vote may not directly elect the president, but if your 
		  vote joins enough others in your voting district or county, your vote undoubtedly matters when it comes to electoral results. Most states 
		  have a “winner take all” system where the popular vote winner gets the state’s electoral votes. Do not rely on faith, confidence, or trust
		  from your desired candidate to win. Do not rely on your friends, family or aquintances, to vote for your candidate. Rely on your voice, your
		  support for your candidate, and your action to vote to ensure your candidate, whether it is president, gorvernor, mayor, or alderman, win their
		  election. When you vote, you can proudly say, "I joined this representative's community, and helped in securing the vicotry of this election."
		</p>
		<h2>What You Can Do</h2>
		<p>
		  Vote! Vote! Vote! Incorporate voting into your schedule. Sacrifice that lunch break, the extra 15 minutes of time before work after you drop off
		  your kids to school, delay a plan if necessary. Set reminders, watch the news, subscribe to various social media accounts representing your city
		  or state politics. Below is a form that you can fill out asking you to input basic information like your name, email, and phone number,
		  where you'll be enrolled in reminders via phone call, text message, and email of upcoming voting dates and locations. Thank you for your interest in learning a 
		  little bit more about voting, and most importantly, your interest in making a change!
